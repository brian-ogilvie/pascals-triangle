# Pascal's Triangle

Built together by Shane and Brian Ogilvie

## Background

> Pascal's Triangle "can be constructed by first placing a 1 along the left and right edges. Then the triangle can be filled out from the top by adding together the two numbers just above to the left and right of each position in the triangle."

## Tech

This program is a riff on a beginner's coding challenge. Shane (my son) and I first wrote the JS code to calculate the rows in the triangle, and then we used HTML and CSS to render the triangle visually.
